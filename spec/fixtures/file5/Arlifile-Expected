# NOTE: This file has been auto-generated by the Arli library manager
# which integrates with another project `arduino-cmake`. If you are
# curious as to how you can build complex Arduino Projects using Arli,
# we suggest that you run the following commands to explore Arli:
# 
#      arli generate MyTestProject --workspace ~/workspace
#      cd ~/workspace/MyTestProject
#      mkdir build; cd build
#      cmake ..
#      make                        <— builds your firmware
#      make upload                 <— uploads your firmware to the device
#      make MyTestProject-serial   <— starts a screen session with serial connection
#
# And you should see a binary image built for the default board, or the 
# board you specified in the Arlifile.
